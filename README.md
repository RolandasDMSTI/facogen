## Automatic generator of semi-structured documents (SSDs)
This project generates semi-structured documents ( invoices, payslips, and receipts). 

This is the Java implementation of our two papers :

Blanchard, J., Bela誰d, Y., & Bela誰d, A. (2019, September). Automatic generation of a custom corpora for invoice analysis and recognition. In 2019 International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition Workshops (ICDARW). IEEE.

and
 
Belhadj, D., Bela誰d, Y., & Bela誰d, A. (2021, September). Automatic Generation of Semi-structured Documents. In International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (pp. 191-205). Springer, Cham.

### SSDs generation  : 
- We can generate locally the three SSDs as well as the cloned invoices separately by launching :
 
  Testlanuch
 
- We can choose to generate these documents via the API web interface by launching :
mvn quarkus:dev 
and then by accessing :
http://localhost:9080/api/ws/ 

### Diversity evaluation :
- We can evaluate the diversity of the local generated SSD datasets using 4 metrics :
Alignement, overlapping, SCR_score, and SELF-BLEU :
